~~Developing the environment to work properly. Next, I need to implement a way to add underscores for each letter in the word. Then I need to come up with a way to modify the body correctly. I think I'm going to put the string into a vector delimited by '\n'. Then I am going to add a toString method for the environment. ~~

Then I need to add a vector to the Environment class called guessed letters. 
Then I need to append letters to that vector and format them properly. 
Then I need to display text properly in the "Answers" field.
